If Jennifer initially had 40 cans and she bought an additional 6 cans for each group of 5 that Mark bought, and since Mark bought 10 groups (as you calculated), Jennifer would have bought \\(10 \\times 6 = 60\\) extra cans. Adding these to her initial 40 cans gives a total of:\n\n\\[ 40 + 60 = 100 \\]\n\nSo, Jennifer brought home a total of 100 cans of milk from the store.\n\nWell done!
