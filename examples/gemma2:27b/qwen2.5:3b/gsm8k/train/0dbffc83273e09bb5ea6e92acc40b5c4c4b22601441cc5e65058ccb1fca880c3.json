Can you calculate that total time by adding two hours for a trip to work and two more hours for a trip back home? Remember, this is just for one round trip of walking."

Now that you know it takes Roque 12 hours for walking to and from work three times a week, how many hours does he spend riding his bike to and from work twice a week?

            "content": "You've correctly calculated that it takes Roque 2 hours for one round trip of biking. Now you know he rides his bike twice a week. To find the total time spent biking in a week, you need to multiply this by the number of times he bikes in a week.\n\nCan you add the total time spent walking in a week (which is 12 hours) to the total time spent biking in a week and tell me what that sum is?"
