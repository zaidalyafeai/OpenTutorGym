The total number of apples in the basket is 15.\n\nTo find out how many whole apples you have left, you need to determine how much of an apple you actually consumed and then subtract that from the total.\n\nSince you ate \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\) of one apple, we need to figure out what part of a whole apple that represents. \n\nIf 15 whole apples represent 1 (the whole), then \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\) of an apple would be less than a whole apple.\n\nLet's calculate how many whole apples you have left by subtracting the fraction you ate from the total:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Whole apples left} = 15 - \\left( \\frac{2}{3} \\right)\n\\]\n\nTo do this, you can think about it like this: If 1 apple is divided into 3 parts (each part being \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\)), then eating \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\) of an apple means you eat 2 of those parts.\n\nSo, if you have 15 apples and you eat 2 out of these 3 parts from each apple:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Whole apples left} = 15 - 2\n\\]\n\nCan you solve this final calculation to find out how many whole apples are left?"
