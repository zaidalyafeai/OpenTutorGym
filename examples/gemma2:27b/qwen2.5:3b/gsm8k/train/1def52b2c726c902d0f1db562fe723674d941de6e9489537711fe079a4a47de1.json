        {
            "role": "Student",
            "content": "So, he writes 3 pages per letter * 2 friends = 6 pages each time he writes.  \n\nThen since he writes twice a week, is it 6 pages * 2 = 12 pages a week? \n\n\n"

            "role": "Tutor",
            "content": "Exactly! You've figured out that James writes 6 pages for each of the two letters he writes in one sitting. And since he does this writing twice a week, you got 12 pages per week. Now, to find out how many pages he writes in a year, can you think about how many weeks are there in a year?"

        {
            "role": "Tutor",
            "content": "That's correct! There are 52 weeks in a year. If you multiply the number of pages James writes each week by the number of weeks in a year, you can find out how many pages he writes in total for the whole year. Can you do that calculation now? Multiply your weekly pages by 52."

            "role": "Student",
