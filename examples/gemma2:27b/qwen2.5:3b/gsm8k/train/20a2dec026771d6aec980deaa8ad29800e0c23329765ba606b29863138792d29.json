Let's verify the steps:\n\n- Total flowers: 25 roses + 40 tulips + 35 daisies = 100 flowers\n- Flowers that are not roses: 100 total - 25 roses = 75 flowers\n\nTo find the percentage of flowers that are not roses:\n\\[ \\left( \\frac{75}{100} \\right) \\times 100\\% = 75\\% \\]\n\nSo, the percentage of flowers that are not roses is indeed 75%.\n\nWell done!
