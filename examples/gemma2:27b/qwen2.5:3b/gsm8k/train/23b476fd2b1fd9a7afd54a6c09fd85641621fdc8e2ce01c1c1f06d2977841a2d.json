            "role": "Student",
            "content": "The extra amount she gets for every overtime hour is $20.\n\nSo, her total overtime pay would be 10 hours * $20/hour = $200  \n\nWhat do I do next to find her total income?"

            "role": "Tutor",
            "content": "You've done a great job so far! Now that you know the extra amount she earns for the overtime hours, how do you calculate her total income by adding this to her regular pay of $500? Remember, that's before we add the overtime pay. Can you write it down to find out her total income?"
