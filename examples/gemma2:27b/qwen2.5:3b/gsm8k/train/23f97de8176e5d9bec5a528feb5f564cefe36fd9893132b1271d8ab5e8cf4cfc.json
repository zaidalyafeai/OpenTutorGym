Weng earned $10 from babysitting for 50 minutes.\n\nTo verify:\n- Her hourly rate is $12.\n- She worked 50 minutes, which is \\(\\frac{50}{60}\\) of an hour.\n- So, her earnings are \\(12 \\times \\frac{50}{60} = 12 \\times \\frac{5}{6} = 12 \\times 0.8333\\ldots = 10\\).\n\nWeng earned $10 from babysitting for 50 minutes.\n\nExcellent work! You've solved the problem on your own now. If you have any more questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask. Good job!"
