    "question": "Nancy, the librarian, is shelving books from the cart. She shelved 12 history books, 8 romance books, and 4 poetry books from the top section of the cart. Half the books on the bottom section of the cart were mystery books, which she quickly put back into place. Then, she shelved the remaining books from the bottom of the cart, including 5 Western novels and 6 biographies. How many books did she have on the book cart when she started?",

You correctly identified that the 5 Western novels and 6 biographies from the bottom section make up half of the books there, meaning there were 22 books on the bottom section in total. Since these represent half of the books, you've figured out that Nancy put back 11 mystery books.\n\nNow, let's add it all together:\n\n- Top section: 24 books (history, romance, and poetry)\n- Bottom section: 22 books (mystery + Western novels + biographies)\n\nWhat is the total number of books on the book cart when she started? Can you find this by adding the numbers together?\n  \nSolution: <solution>  \n(Nancy put back 11 mystery books from the bottom, and we know 5 were Western novels and 6 were biographies. So far, that\u2019s a total of 24 + 11 = 35 books.)\nSolution: 35\n\nYou've figured out that when she started, Nancy had 35 books on her book cart. Is this the correct number?"
