    "question": "John orders food for a massive restaurant.  He orders 1000 pounds of beef for $8 per pound.  He also orders twice that much chicken at $3 per pound.  How much did everything cost?",

Now that you know the beef costs $8000 and the chicken costs $6000, can you add these two amounts to find out the total cost for both the beef and chicken? Remember, just like when you're adding numbers in your homework, you'll be adding these together."

The total cost for everything is \\$14000. Congratulations on solving the problem yourself!\n\n<END>"
