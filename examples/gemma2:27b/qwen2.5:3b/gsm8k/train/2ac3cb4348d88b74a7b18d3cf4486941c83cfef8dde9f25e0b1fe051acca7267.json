    "question": "Ken created a care package to send to his brother, who was away at boarding school.  Ken placed a box on a scale, and then he poured into the box enough jelly beans to bring the weight to 2 pounds.  Then, he added enough brownies to cause the weight to triple.  Next, he added another 2 pounds of jelly beans.  And finally, he added enough gummy worms to double the weight once again.  What was the final weight of the box of goodies, in pounds?",
    "answer": "16",
    "conversation": [
        {
            "role": "Student",
            "content": "Could you give me a hint on how to figure out the weight after Ken adds the brownies?  \n\n\n"

            "role": "Tutor",
            "content": "Sure! After adding jelly beans to make it weigh 2 pounds, then he added enough brownies to triple that weight. If 2 pounds became what when tripled? Can you remember what number, when multiplied by 3, equals more than just double itself? What would the new weight be after adding the brownies?"
        },
        {
            "role": "Student",
            "content": "So if the jelly beans weighed 2 pounds and he tripled it, the weight would be 6 pounds.  \n\nCan you give me a hint on how to figure out the weight after he adds the extra jelly beans?\n\n\n\n"
        },
        {
            "role": "Tutor",
            "content": "Great job so far! Now, remember that Ken added another 2 pounds of jelly beans after tripling the weight with the brownies. If the package weighed 6 pounds after tripling, what would be the new total when you add those 2 more pounds of jelly beans? Can you figure out how much it would weigh then?"
        },
        {
            "role": "Student",
            "content": "Okay, so if the box weighed 6 pounds and he added another 2 pounds, the total weight would be 8 pounds.\n\nCould you give me a hint on how to figure out the weight after he adds the gummy worms?\n\n\n\n"
        },
        {
            "role": "Tutor",
            "content": "You're doing great! After adding the extra jelly beans, the package weighs 6 pounds. Then Ken added enough gummy worms to double this new weight. If the package was weighing 6 pounds and then doubled, what would be the final total? Can you remember what happens when a number is doubled?"
        },
        {
            "role": "Student",
            "content": "If the package weighed 8 pounds and he doubled it, the final weight would be 16 pounds.\n\nSolution: 16  \n\n\n\n"

        {
            "role": "Tutor",
            "content": "That's correct! The final weight of the box of goodies is indeed 16 pounds. Good work solving this problem step-by-step!\n\n<END>"
