    "question": "An earthquake caused four buildings to collapse. Experts predicted that each following earthquake would have double the number of collapsing buildings as the previous one, since each one would make the foundations less stable. After three more earthquakes, how many buildings had collapsed including those from the first earthquake?",
    "answer": "60",

            "role": "Tutor",
            "content": "That's correct! If the second earthquake caused 8 buildings to collapse, then the third earthquake would indeed have twice that amount collapsing, which is 16 buildings. Following this pattern, the fourth earthquake would double the number of the third one, causing 32 buildings to collapse.\n\nNow, let's add up all the buildings from the first four earthquakes together. How many buildings collapsed in total?"

Let's add up all the numbers:\n- First earthquake: 4 buildings\n- Second earthquake: 8 buildings\n- Third earthquake: 16 buildings\n- Fourth earthquake: 32 buildings\n\nAdding these together:\n\n\\[ 4 + 8 + 16 + 32 = 56 \\]\n\nSo, a total of 56 buildings collapsed. Well done!"

The total number of buildings that had collapsed after the first earthquake and the following three earthquakes is indeed **56**.\n\nYou've done an excellent job understanding and applying the pattern described in the problem.
