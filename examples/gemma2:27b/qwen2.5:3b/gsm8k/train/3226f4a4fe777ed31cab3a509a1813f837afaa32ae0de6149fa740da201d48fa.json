    "question": "A bear is preparing to hibernate for the winter and needs to gain 1000 pounds. At the end of summer, the bear feasts on berries and small woodland animals. During autumn, it devours acorns and salmon. It gained a fifth of the weight it needed from berries during summer, and during autumn, it gained twice that amount from acorns. Salmon made up half of the remaining weight it had needed to gain. How many pounds did it gain eating small animals?",

            "content": "You have already determined that salmon made up half of what was left after berries and acorns were accounted for. If the bear needed to gain 600 pounds in total and it gained 400 pounds (berries) + 400 pounds (acorns), then how much did it gain from small woodland animals? Remember, this amount plus the weight from salmon equals the total needed gain of 1000 pounds."

            "role": "Tutor",
            "content": "You have calculated that the bear gained 200 pounds eating small woodland animals. To verify, let's check the calculations:\n\n- From berries: \\( \\frac{1}{5} \\times 1000 = 200 \\) pounds\n- From acorns: Twice the amount from berries, so \\( 2 \\times 200 = 400 \\) pounds\n- Salmon made up half of what was left after berries and acorns. Since the bear needed to gain 600 more pounds (after gaining 200 + 400 = 600 pounds from berries and acorns), salmon provided \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\times 600 = 300 \\) pounds\n\nAdding these up: \\( 200 \\, (\\text{berries}) + 400 \\, (\\text{acorns}) + 300 \\, (\\text{salmon}) = 900 \\) pounds. \n\nThe bear gained 200 pounds eating small woodland animals to reach the total of 1000 pounds needed for hibernation.\n\nGood job on solving this problem!"
