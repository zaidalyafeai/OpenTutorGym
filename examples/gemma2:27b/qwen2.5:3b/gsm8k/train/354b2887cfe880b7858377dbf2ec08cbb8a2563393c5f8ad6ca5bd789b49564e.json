    "question": "A family of 12 monkeys collected 10 piles of bananas. 6 piles had 9 hands, with each hand having 14 bananas, while the remaining piles had 12 hands, with each hand having 9 bananas. How many bananas would each monkey get if they divide the bananas equally amongst themselves?",

To find out how many bananas are in one of the piles that have 9 hands, with each hand having 14 bananas, you need to multiply the number of hands by the number of bananas per hand. Can you calculate that for yourself? Remember to show your work so we can check it together."

You've calculated that each pile with 9 hands, where each hand has 14 bananas, contains 126 bananas.\n\nNow, let's find out how many bananas are in the second type of pile. Each of these piles has 12 hands, and each hand has 9 bananas. Can you calculate how many bananas are in one of these piles? Show your work so we can check it together."

You correctly calculated that each pile with 12 hands, where each hand has 9 bananas, contains 108 bananas.\n\nNow, to find the total number of bananas collected by the family of monkeys, we need to calculate the total for both types of piles. There are 6 piles like the first type and 4 piles like the second type.\n\nFor the 6 piles with 9 hands each:\n\\[ 6 \\text{ piles} \\times 126 \\text{ bananas/pile} = 756 \\text{ bananas} \\]\n\nFor the 4 piles with 12 hands each:\n\\[ 4 \\text{ piles} \\times 108 \\text{ bananas/pile} = 432 \\text{ bananas} \\]\n\nNow, let's add these together to find the total number of bananas collected by the family.\nCan you calculate the sum?

There are 12 monkeys in the family.\n\n\\[ 1188 \\div 12 = 99 \\text{ bananas/monkey} \\]\n\nSo, each monkey would get 99 bananas if they divide the bananas equally amongst themselves.\nCan you confirm this calculation and show your work?"
