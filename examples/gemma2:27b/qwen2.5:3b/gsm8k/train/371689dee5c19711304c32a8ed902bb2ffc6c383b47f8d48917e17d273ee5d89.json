Since the same recipe makes enough cookies for 16 people with 2 cups of flour, we need to find out how many times more flour is needed to make enough cookies for 48 people (which is double the number of people as 16).\n\nSo, if 2 cups are used for 16 people, how much flour would be needed for 32 people (double the number)?
