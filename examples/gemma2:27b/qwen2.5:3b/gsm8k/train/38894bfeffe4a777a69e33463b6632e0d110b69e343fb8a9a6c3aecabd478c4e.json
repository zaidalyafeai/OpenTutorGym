        {
            "role": "Student",
            "content": "If we subtract the 80 liters from the total 290 liters, that leaves 290 - 80 = 210 liters of oil.  \n\nIs that right?\n\n \n"

Since those remaining cans make up the rest of the 24 cans, and we know the total number of cans is still 24, how many cans are these remaining cans? Can you figure that out?"

            "role": "Tutor",
            "content": "That's correct! You've figured out that there are now 14 remaining cans. Since we know these 14 cans hold the remaining 210 liters of oil, how much oil does each of these remaining cans contain? Can you find out by dividing the total amount of oil in the remaining cans by the number of remaining cans?"

            "role": "Student",
            "content": "So if we divide the 210 liters of oil by the 14 cans, that means each can holds 210 / 14 = 15 liters of oil.  \n\nIs that right?\n\n\n\n"
