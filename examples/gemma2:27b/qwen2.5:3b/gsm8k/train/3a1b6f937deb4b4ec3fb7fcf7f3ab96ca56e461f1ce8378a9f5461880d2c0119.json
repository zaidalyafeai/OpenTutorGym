    "question": "John's cow weighs 400 pounds.  It increased its weight to 1.5 times its starting weight.  He is able to sell the cow for $3 per pound.  How much more is it worth after gaining the weight?",

            "content": "Great job! You've calculated that the cow now weighs 600 pounds. Now, to find out how much more it's worth after gaining weight, you need to calculate the difference in value based on its new weight and see how much less it was originally. How can you find this difference? Think about what you know so far: the original price per pound was $3, but now it\u2019s a different amount because of its increased weight."

            "role": "Tutor",
            "content": "Exactly right! Now that you know the cow weighs 600 pounds at the new weight, you can calculate how much it's worth per pound by multiplying its new weight by $3. Then you need to find out what the cow was originally worth (by multiplying the original weight by $3). Finally, subtract the original value from the new value to see how much more valuable the cow is now.\n\nCan you do these calculations step by step? Start with finding the new value of the cow per pound.\nSolution: <solution> \nPlease provide your solution so I can verify it."

            "content": "You've correctly calculated that the cow is worth $1800 per pound at its new weight of 600 pounds. Now, to find out how much more valuable it is after gaining weight, you need to know what its original value was before it gained weight.\n\nTo do this, you multiply the original weight (400 pounds) by the price per pound ($3/pound). Can you calculate the original value of the cow? Then subtract that from the new value."

            "content": "You've done a great job working through this problem step-by-step! Let's verify your calculations.\n\nThe original weight of the cow was 400 pounds, and you calculated that its value per pound is $3. So the original value is indeed:\n\n\\[ 400 \\text{ pounds} \\times \\$3/\\text{pound} = \\$1200 \\]\n\nNow, the new weight of the cow after gaining weight is 600 pounds. The new value per pound remains $3, so the new value is:\n\n\\[ 600 \\text{ pounds} \\times \\$3/\\text{pound} = \\$1800 \\]\n\nTo find out how much more valuable it is now, you subtract the original value from the new value:\n\n\\[ \\$1800 - \\$1200 = \\$600 \\]\n\nYour solution is correct! The cow is worth $600 more after gaining weight. Congratulations on solving this problem yourself!\n\n<END>"
