    "question": "Manny had 3 birthday cookie pies to share with his 24 classmates and his teacher, Mr. Keith.   If each of the cookie pies were cut into 10 slices and Manny, his classmates, and Mr. Keith all had 1 piece, how many slices are left?",

Manny plus his 24 classmates and his teacher Mr. Keith all had one slice each. Can you figure out how many slices were eaten by adding these numbers together? That will tell you how many slices are left.\n"

So if we add Manny (1), his 24 classmates (24), and Mr. Keith (1) together, how many total people are there? Can you calculate this to find out?\n"

Now, if each person had one slice, how many slices were eaten altogether? Can you subtract this number from the total number of slices to find out how many slices are left?\n\nRemember, you have 30 slices and you need to subtract 26 slices that were eaten.\n"

To find out how many slices are left, you need to subtract the 26 slices that were eaten from the total of 30 slices.\n\nCan you perform this subtraction and tell me how many slices are left?\nIt looks like a simple calculation\u2014subtracting 26 from 30."

            "content": "That's correct! You've found that there are 4 slices left after the 26 people ate their portions.\n\nSo, if we start with 30 slices and subtract 26 slices eaten:\n\n\\[ 30 - 26 = 4 \\]\n\nTherefore, there are indeed 4 slices left. Well done on solving this problem!\n\nIf you have any more questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask! <END>"
