    "question": "Tim rides his bike back and forth to work for each of his 5 workdays.  His work is 20 miles away.  He also goes for a weekend bike ride of 200 miles.    If he can bike at 25 mph how much time does he spend biking a week?",

Now, to find out how much time he spends biking, we need to use the speed at which he bikes. Can you figure out how many hours that would be given he bikes at a speed of 25 mph?"

You correctly divide the total distance by his biking speed to find the hours. \n\nThen, you need to add in the time for his weekend bike ride of 200 miles at the same speed of 25 mph.

Let's calculate that and then add it to the time spent on the workweek biking.\n\nSo, let's start with calculating the weekend ride time:\n\\[ \\text{Time for weekend ride} = \\frac{\\text{Distance}}{\\text{Speed}} = \\frac{200 \\text{ miles}}{25 \\text{ mph}} \\]\n\nWhat do you get when you calculate that?"

You've calculated that he bikes 40 miles each day for 5 days:\n\\[ \\text{Time for workweek} = 40 \\text{ miles/day} \\times 5 \\text{ days} \\]\n\nCan you calculate how many hours this is at a speed of 25 mph? Remember, we need to do the same division as before. Once you have that time for his workweek biking, add it to the 8 hours from the weekend ride. What do you get in total hours spent biking during the week?"

The time spent biking during Tim's workweek is indeed 8 hours, and since the weekend bike ride also takes 8 hours at the same speed, the total time he spends biking each week is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total biking time} = 8 \\text{ hours (workweek)} + 8 \\text{ hours (weekend)} = 16 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nSo, Tim spends a total of 16 hours biking during his workweek and weekend rides.\n\nGreat job solving this problem step-by-step!
