    "question": "Jerry\u2019s two daughters play softball on different teams. They each have 8 games this season. Each team practices 4 hours for every game they play. If each game lasts for 2 hours, how many hours will Jerry spend at the field watching his daughters play and practice altogether?",
    "answer": "96",

            "content": "That\u2019s correct! Now, remember that for every game, there are practices. Each team practices 4 hours for every game they play. How many hours in total will Jerry spend watching his daughters practice? Think about it: if one daughter has 8 games and the other also has 8 games, how many practices do you think each of them will have?\n"

            "content": "If there are 4 hours of practice per game and each daughter plays 8 games, then each daughter will have 32 hours of practice (4 x 8 = 32)?  \n\nSince Jerry has two daughters, would that mean a total of 64 hours of practice (32 x 2 = 64) ?"

            "role": "Tutor",
            "content": "You're doing great so far! Yes, each daughter will have 32 hours of practice because there are 4 hours of practice for every game and she plays 8 games. So, the total practice time for both daughters combined would be 64 hours (32 x 2 = 64). Now, let's add the time spent at games to find out the total hours Jerry will spend at the field. How many hours will that be? Think about adding the hours from practices and games.\n"

            "role": "Tutor",
            "content": "You've done an excellent job so far! Let's add up all the times to make sure we have the correct total. You\u2019ve calculated that each daughter plays 16 game hours (2 x 8), and since there are two daughters, that\u2019s a total of 32 game hours (16 x 2). Adding the practice time you found earlier (64 hours) gives us:\n\n- Total game hours: 32\n- Total practice hours: 64\n\nAdding these together: \\(32 + 64 = 96\\) hours.\n\nSo, Jerry will spend a total of 96 hours at the field watching his daughters play and practice. Well done for getting this correct! If you have any other questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask. You've solved it brilliantly!\n\n<END>"
