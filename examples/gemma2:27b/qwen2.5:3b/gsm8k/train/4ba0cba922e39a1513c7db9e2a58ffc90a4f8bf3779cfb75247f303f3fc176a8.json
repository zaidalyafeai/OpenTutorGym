    "question": "Jesse and Mia are competing in a week long race. They have one week to run 30 miles. On the first three days Jesse averages (2/3) of a mile. On day four she runs 10 miles. Mia averages 3 miles a day over the first 4 days. What is the average of their average that they have to run over the final three days?",
