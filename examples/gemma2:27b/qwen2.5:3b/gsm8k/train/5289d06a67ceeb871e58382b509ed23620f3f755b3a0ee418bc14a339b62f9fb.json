    "question": "Tina makes $18.00 an hour.  If she works more than 8 hours per shift, she is eligible for overtime, which is paid by your hourly wage + 1/2 your hourly wage.  If she works 10 hours every day for 5 days, how much money does she make?",

Can you think about how much her regular pay and overtime pay would be separately? Remember, regular pay is at her normal hourly rate, and overtime pay includes an extra half-hour pay for those additional hours.\n"

Now you have calculated that Tina makes $144.00 for her regular 8 hours and $54.00 for her 2 hours of overtime in one day. \n\nTo find out how much she makes in total over 5 days, just add up the daily totals. Can you do this calculation? Remember to include both her regular pay and her overtime pay from each day."

Let's verify your final calculation:\n\n- Daily earnings (regular + overtime): \\( \\$144.00 + \\$54.00 = \\$198.00 \\)\n- Over 5 days: \\( \\$198.00/day * 5 \\text{ days} = \\$990.00 \\)\n\nYour solution is correct!
