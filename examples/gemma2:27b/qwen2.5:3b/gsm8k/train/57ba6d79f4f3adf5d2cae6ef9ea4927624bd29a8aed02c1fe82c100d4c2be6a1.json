If there are 18 people in total, how can we figure out how many packs of trail mix Roger needs to buy so that every person gets one pouch? \n\nHow many full packs do you think would be enough for everyone? Can you calculate the number of packs needed by dividing the total number of people by the number of pouches per pack?\n"
