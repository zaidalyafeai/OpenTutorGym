So, each discounted ticket would cost $40 - $2 = $38. \n\nNow, since Mr. Benson bought 2 tickets that are eligible for this discount, do you see how much he paid in total for these 2 discounted tickets? Remember to calculate the total by multiplying the discounted price by 2."

Now, to find the total amount he paid for all 12 tickets, do you just need to add the cost of the discounted tickets ($76) to the cost of the full-price tickets ($400)?\n\nLet's calculate that together: $400 (for the full-price tickets) + $76 (for the discounted tickets). \n\nWhat do you get when you add these amounts?"

Mr. Benson paid a total of $476 for all 12 concert tickets.\n\nTo verify, let's check the math:\n\n- He bought 10 full-price tickets at $40 each: \\(10 \\times 40 = 400\\)\n- He bought 2 discounted tickets at $38 each (5% off of $40): \\(2 \\times 38 = 76\\)\n\nAdding these together: \\(400 + 76 = 476\\).\n\nSo, your solution is correct! Well done. If you have any more questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask. You've got this! \n\n<END>"
