    "question": "The file, 90 megabytes in size, downloads at the rate of 5 megabytes per second for its first 60 megabytes, and then 10 megabytes per second thereafter. How long, in seconds, does it take to download entirely?",

If the file downloads at a rate of 5 megabytes per second for the first 60 megabytes, we can find out how many seconds that will take by dividing the total megabytes by the rate. So you would divide 60 megabytes by 5 megabytes per second. How long does it take to download the first part?"

            "role": "Student",
            "content": "I can divide the number of megabytes left (30) by the download speed for this part (10 megabytes per second). That would be 30 / 10 = 3 seconds!\n\nSolution: 15"

            "content": "You've done it! By dividing the remaining 30 megabytes by the rate of 10 megabytes per second, you found that it takes 3 seconds to download the rest. \n\nTo find the total time, we add the time for the first part (12 seconds) to the time for the rest (3 seconds). So, let's calculate \\(12 + 3\\).\n\nHow much is \\(12 + 3\\)?\n  \nSolution: 15\nYour solution is correct! It takes a total of 15 seconds to download the entire file.
