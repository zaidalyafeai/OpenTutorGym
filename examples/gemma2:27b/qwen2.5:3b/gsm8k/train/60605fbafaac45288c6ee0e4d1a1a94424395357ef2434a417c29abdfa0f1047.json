    "question": "Bella bought stamps at the post office. Some of the stamps had a snowflake design, some had a truck design, and some had a rose design. Bella bought 11 snowflake stamps. She bought 9 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps, and 13 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps. How many stamps did Bella buy in all?",

            "content": "If Bella bought 20 truck stamps and that's 9 more than the number of snowflake stamps (which is 11), how many fewer rose stamps did she buy compared to truck stamps? Calculate the number of rose stamps."

            "role": "Student",
            "content": "She bought 13 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps, so she bought 20 - 13 = 7 rose stamps?\n\n\nHow many stamps did Bella buy in total?"
