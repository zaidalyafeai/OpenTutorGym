Let's verify this:\n\n- Each jaguar eats 5 snakes.\n- There are 6 jaguars, so the total number of snakes eaten in a day by these jaguars is \\( 6 \\times 5 = 30 \\) snakes.\n- Each snake eats 3 birds per day, so the total number of birds eaten in a day by these snakes is \\( 30 \\times 3 = 90 \\) birds.\n- Each bird eats 12 beetles per day, so the total number of beetles eaten per day by these birds is \\( 90 \\times 12 = 1080 \\) beetles.\n\nSince your calculation matches this logic, it's correct! Well done!\n\nSolution: 1080  \n<END>"
