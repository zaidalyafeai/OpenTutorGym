    "question": "Alice has 20 quarters. She wants to exchange them for nickels and so she goes to the bank. After getting back from the bank, she discovers that 20% of the nickels are iron nickels worth $3 each. What is the total value of her money now?",

Now, to find the total value of these iron nickels, you multiply the number of iron nickels by their value: \\( 20 \\times 3 = \\$6 \\).\n\nNext, you need to determine how many regular nickels Alice has. Since she started with 100 nickels and now knows that 20 of them are iron nickels, what is left for the regular nickels?\n\nOnce you have the number of regular nickels, you can find their total value by multiplying this number by the value of one nickel (which is 5 cents). \n\nLet's see if you get the total value of Alice's money now by adding the value of both the iron nickels and the regular nickels."

Let's verify the steps you took:\n\n- Alice started with 100 nickels.\n- She found out that 20 of these are iron nickels worth $3 each, which totals to \\(20 \\times 3 = \\$6.00\\).\n- The remaining 80 nickels are regular nickels, and since each nickel is worth 5 cents (\\$0.05), their total value is \\(80 \\times 0.05 = \\$4.00\\).\n\nAdding these together:\n\n\\[ 6 + 4 = 10 \\]\n\nSo, Alice's total money now is indeed $10.00.\n\nWell done!
