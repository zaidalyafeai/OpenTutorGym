    "question": "James is a first-year student at a University in Chicago. He has a budget of $1000 per semester. He spends 30% of his money on food, 15% on accommodation, 25% on entertainment, and the rest on coursework materials. How much money does he spend on coursework materials?",
    "answer": "300",
    "conversation": [
        {
            "role": "Student",
            "content": "I know I need to figure out how much James spends on coursework materials. \n\nCan you give me a hint about how to start solving this problem?  \n"
        },
        {
            "role": "Tutor",
            "content": "Sure! Let's think about it step by step. You have $1000 for the semester and you spend parts of that money on different things like food, accommodation, entertainment, and coursework materials. First, what do you need to find out \u2013 how much he spends on each part or how much is left for coursework materials?"

        {

        },
        {
            "role": "Tutor",
            "content": "Of course! You know that 30% of his $1000 is spent on food, 15% on accommodation, and 25% on entertainment. To find out how much he spends on each of these things, you can calculate it by multiplying the total budget by the percentage for each category. Would you like to try calculating it yourself first?"
        },
        {
            "role": "Student",
            "content": "Okay, I think I understand.\n\nLet me see...30% of $1000 is (0.30) * ($1000) = $300 for food. \n\nAnd 15% of $1000 is (0.15) * ($1000) = $150 for accommodation.\n\nLastly, 25% of $1000 is (0.25) * ($1000) = $250 for entertainment.\n\nIs that correct so far?"
        },
        {
            "role": "Tutor",
            "content": "Yes, you're absolutely right! You've calculated correctly:\n\n- 30% of $1000 is $300 spent on food.\n- 15% of $1000 is $150 spent on accommodation.\n- 25% of $1000 is $250 spent on entertainment.\n\nNow, to find out how much he spends on coursework materials, you need to calculate what's left after spending on food, accommodation, and entertainment. You have already calculated the total spent on these three categories. What do you think should be your next step?"
        },
        {
            "role": "Student",
            "content": "I need to add up the amounts I spent on food, accommodation, and entertainment.\n\nThen, I can subtract that total from my original budget of $1000 to find out how much is left for coursework materials.  \n\n\nIs that right?"
        },
        {
            "role": "Tutor",
            "content": "Exactly! You've got it. \n\nNow you should add up the amounts you spent on food ($300), accommodation ($150), and entertainment ($250). Then, subtract this total from your original budget of $1000 to find out how much is left for coursework materials.\n\nDo you want to try calculating that now?"
        },
        {
            "role": "Student",
            "content": "Okay, here goes: \n\n$300 (food) + $150 (accommodation) + $250 (entertainment) = $700 total spent on those things.\n\n\n$1000 (budget) - $700 (other expenses) = $300 left for coursework materials.\n\n\n\nSolution: 300"
        },
        {
            "role": "Tutor",
            "content": "Great job! You've done it correctly. \n\nLet's verify the calculation:\n\n- Total spent on food, accommodation, and entertainment: \n  \\[\n  \\$300 + \\$150 + \\$250 = \\$700\n  \\]\n\n- Money left for coursework materials:\n  \\[\n  \\$1000 - \\$700 = \\$300\n  \\]\n\nSo, James spends $300 on coursework materials.\n\nCongratulations on solving the problem yourself!
