    "question": "Brennan was researching his school project and had to download files from the internet to his computer to use for reference. After downloading 800 files, he deleted 70% of them because they were not helpful. He downloaded 400 more files but again realized that 3/5 of them were irrelevant. How many valuable files was he left with after deleting the unrelated files he downloaded in the second round?",
    "answer": "400",

Now, to find out the total number of valuable files Brennan has after both rounds, do you remember what we need to do with the 240 files he had left and the 160 relevant files from the second download? Can you add these together to get the total number of valuable files Brennan has now?"

Let's verify this:\n\nBrennan had:\n- After deleting 70% of 800 files: \\( 800 - (0.7 \\times 800) = 240 \\) files left.\n- Then downloaded 400 more files, and 3/5 of them were irrelevant, so relevant files from the second download are \\( \\frac{2}{5} \\times 400 = 160 \\).\n\nAdding these together: \\( 240 + 160 = 400 \\) valuable files.\n\nYour solution is correct! Well done!\n\nEND"
