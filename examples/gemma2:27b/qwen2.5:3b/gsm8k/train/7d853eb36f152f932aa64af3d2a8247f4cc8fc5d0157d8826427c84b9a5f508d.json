    "question": "The profit from a business transaction is shared among 2 business partners, Mike and Johnson in the ratio 2:5 respectively. If Johnson got $2500, how much will Mike have after spending some of his share on a shirt that costs $200?",

If Johnson got $2500, how much was his share in terms of the total profit? Can you figure out what one part of the ratio (which is $7) equals in dollars?"

Mike will have $800 left after spending $200 on the shirt. \n\nTo verify, let's see if everything checks out:\n\n- The ratio is 2:5, and Johnson\u2019s share (5 parts) was $2500.\n- Each part of the ratio is worth $500 ($2500 \u00f7 5).\n- Mike\u2019s share (2 parts) would be $1000 ($500 \u00d7 2).\n\nAfter spending $200 on a shirt:\n- Mike's initial profit: $1000\n- After spending $200: $800\n\nSo, your solution is correct! Well done.\n\n<END>"
