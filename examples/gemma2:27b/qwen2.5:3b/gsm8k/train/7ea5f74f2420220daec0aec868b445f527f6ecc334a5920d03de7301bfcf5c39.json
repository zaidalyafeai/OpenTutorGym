            "content": "Let's verify this. If Carlos memorized 4 digits, then Sam, who memorized six more digits than Carlos, would have memorized \\(4 + 6 = 10\\) digits. Is that correct so far?\n\nNow let's check if the information about Mina aligns with Sam and Carlos' digit counts:\n- Mina has 24 digits.\n- If Carlos has 4 digits and Sam has 10 digits, together they have \\(4 + 10 = 14\\) digits.\n\nDoes this seem correct in relation to what we know? Remember, the total should be consistent with the information given. \n\nLet's confirm if Mina having 24 digits as six times Carlos' is also supported by this.\nIf Carlos has 4 digits and Sam has 10 digits, then together they have \\(4 + 10 = 14\\) digits. Since Mina has 6 times the number of digits Carlos has, she would have \\(4 \\times 6 = 24\\) digits, which matches the information given.\n\nSo your solution looks correct! Congratulations on solving this problem!\n\n<END>"
