    "question": "A deep-sea monster rises from the waters once every hundred years to feast on a ship and sate its hunger. Over three hundred years, it has consumed 847 people. Ships have been built larger over time, so each new ship has twice as many people as the last ship. How many people were on the ship the monster ate in the first hundred years?",
    "answer": "121",

            "content": "Sure! Let's think about the pattern of people eaten over the centuries. If each new ship has twice as many people as the last one, then in the first hundred years, let's say there were X people on that ship. In the next hundred years (the second rise), would it be more or less than X? Can you figure out how many people might have been eaten in those two hundred years based on the number of people from the first century?\nTry to calculate how many people could have been on the second ship and then see if you can find a pattern for the total over three hundred years."

            "content": "Okay, I think I'm starting to see a pattern!\n\nIf there were X people on the first ship, the second ship would have 2X people.  So in the first two hundred years, the monster ate X + 2X = 3X people. Does that sound right? \n\n\n"

            "role": "Tutor",
            "content": "That sounds correct! You've found that the number of people eaten each hundred-year period doubles from the previous one. If we have \\( X \\) people on the first ship and then \\( 2X \\) on the second, together they make \\( 3X \\). \n\nNow, let's think about what happened in those three hundred years with the total of 847 people eaten by the monster. How many people were eaten in the third period? Can you figure out how to find \\( X \\) using this information?\nRemember, we already know that over two centuries (the first and second periods), \\( 3X \\) people were eaten. We need to use the total of 847 people for all three hundred years now."

            "content": "If the monster eats 3X people in the first two hundred years,  and it eats a total of 847 people over three hundred years, then it must have eaten 847 - 3X people in the third hundred years!\n\nSince each ship holds twice as many people as the last, would the third ship hold 2 * (2X) = 4X people?  \n\nDoes that mean the monster ate 4X people in the third century?\n\n\n\n"

            "role": "Tutor",
            "content": "That's a great thought process! You've figured out that the total number of people eaten over three centuries is \\( 847 \\). Since you know that \\( 3X \\) people were eaten in the first two centuries, you can find \\( X \\) by using this information.\n\nLet's calculate it step-by-step. If the third period (the last century) ate \\( 847 - 3X \\) people and knowing each ship has twice as many people as the previous one, then indeed the third ship would have had \\( 2 \\times 2X = 4X \\) people on it.\n\nSo now you can set up an equation to solve for \\( X \\):\n\\[ 847 - 3X = 4X \\]\n\nCan you solve this equation to find \\( X \\)? Remember, once you have \\( X \\), the number of people on the first ship will be \\( X \\).\nDo you think you can solve this equation and find \\( X \\)?\nI'm here if you need more guidance."

            "role": "Student",
            "content": "Okay, I think I can solve that! \n\nTo get all the X terms together, I can add 3X to both sides of the equation:\n\\[847 = 7X\\]\n\nThen, to isolate X, I can divide both sides by 7:\n\\[ X = \\frac{847}{7}\\]\n\n\nCalculating that gives me \\( X = 121 \\).\n\nSolution: 121 \n"

            "content": "You've done it! You correctly solved the equation and found that \\( X = 121 \\). This means there were 121 people on the ship the monster ate in the first hundred years.\n\nGreat job solving this problem step-by-step. If you have any more questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask!\n\nSolution: 121\n\nCongratulations! You've solved the problem correctly.\n<END>"
