    "question": "Dale and Andrew had breakfast at a cafe. A slice of toast costs \u00a31, and eggs cost \u00a33 each. Dale had 2 slices of toast and 2 eggs. Andrew had 1 slice of toast and 2 eggs. How much did their breakfast cost?",

            "role": "Tutor",
            "content": "Sure! Let's think about it step by step. Dale had 2 slices of toast and 2 eggs. Since each slice of toast costs \u00a31, the cost for the toast is \u00a31 per slice times the number of slices. And since each egg costs \u00a33, we need to add that to the total cost of the toast. What do you get if you calculate how much Dale's breakfast cost based on these prices?"

        {
            "role": "Student",
            "content": "Okay, so 2 slices of toast times \u00a31 per slice equals \u00a32.  Then I need to add 2 eggs times \u00a33 per egg. Does that equal \u00a36?\n\nIf I add \u00a32 and \u00a36 do I get \u00a38 for Dale's breakfast?"

        {
            "role": "Tutor",
            "content": "That's right! You've calculated correctly so far. Now, let's add the cost of the toast and the eggs together to find out how much Dale's breakfast costs in total.\n\n\u00a32 (for the toast) + \u00a36 (for the eggs) equals \u00a38.\n\nSo, Dale\u2019s breakfast cost \u00a38. Let's move on to Andrew's breakfast now. How do you think we should approach that?\nSolution: \u00a38"

        {
            "role": "Tutor",
            "content": "That\u2019s a good start! For Andrew, he had 1 slice of toast, which costs \u00a31, and 2 eggs, each costing \u00a33. So the cost for the eggs would be \u00a33 per egg times 2 eggs.\n\nLet's add up:\n- The toast costs \u00a31.\n- The two eggs cost \u00a33 (since \u00a33 \u00d7 2 = \u00a36).\n\nNow, let\u2019s find out the total cost of Andrew\u2019s breakfast by adding the cost of his toast and his eggs.

            "role": "Tutor",
            "content": "You're close, but there seems to be a small mistake in adding up the costs.\n\nFor Andrew:\n- The toast costs \u00a31.\n- The two eggs cost \u00a33 each, so together they cost \u00a36 (since \u00a33 \u00d7 2 = \u00a36).\n\nNow, let's add these amounts together: \u00a31 (for the toast) + \u00a36 (for the eggs) equals \u00a37.\n\nSo, Andrew\u2019s breakfast also costs \u00a37. \n\nAdding Dale\u2019s and Andrew\u2019s breakfasts together:\n- Dale\u2019s breakfast was \u00a38.\n- Andrew\u2019s breakfast was \u00a37.\n\nTogether, their total breakfast cost is \u00a38 + \u00a37 = \u00a315.\n\nLet's verify if your solution matches this calculation: Solution: 15\n\nIf you get a total of \u00a315, that's correct! You've done well in figuring it out. Well done!\nSolution: 15"
