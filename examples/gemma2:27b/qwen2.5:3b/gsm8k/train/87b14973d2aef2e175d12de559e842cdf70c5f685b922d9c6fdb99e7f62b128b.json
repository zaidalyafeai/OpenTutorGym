    "question": "Nancy is filling an aquarium for her fish. She fills it halfway and goes to answer the door. While she's gone, her cat knocks the aquarium over and spills half the water in it. Then Nancy comes back and triples the amount of water in the aquarium. If the aquarium is 4 feet long, 6 feet wide, and 3 feet high, how many cubic feet of water are in the aquarium?",
    "answer": "54",

            "content": "Excellent work so far! You've calculated the total volume of the aquarium when it is completely full, which is indeed 72 cubic feet. Now, remember that Nancy fills it halfway initially. How many cubic feet of water would that be? Can you calculate half of the total volume you just found?"

Now, while she was away, her cat knocks over the aquarium and spills half of the water inside. How many cubic feet of water would that leave in the aquarium? Can you calculate half of 36 cubic feet?"

You've determined that after the cat spills half of the water, there are 18 cubic feet of water left in the aquarium. \n\nThen Nancy comes back and triples the amount of water in the aquarium. Can you figure out how many cubic feet of water would be in the aquarium now? Remember to multiply the remaining water by 3. What do you get?"

When Nancy triples the amount of water left in the aquarium, there are indeed 54 cubic feet of water inside.\n\nWell done on solving this problem step by step! The final answer is that there are **54 cubic feet** of water in the aquarium. Congratulations on your understanding and persistence!\n\nIf you have any more questions or need further explanations, feel free to ask. <END>"
