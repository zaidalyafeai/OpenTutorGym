    "question": "Liza bought 10 kilograms of butter to make cookies. She used one-half of it for chocolate chip cookies, one-fifth of it for peanut butter cookies, and one-third of the remaining butter for sugar cookies. How many kilograms of butter are left after making those three kinds of cookies?",
    "answer": "2",

            "content": "That's correct! You calculated right by dividing 10 kilograms by 2. Now, if she used half for chocolate chip cookies, how much did she use for peanut butter cookies? Can you find one-fifth of the total amount of butter?"

            "content": "Exactly right! You divided 10 kilograms by 5 to get 2 kilograms. So, Liza used 2 kilograms of butter for peanut butter cookies. Now, if you subtract the butter used for chocolate chip and peanut butter cookies from the total, how much butter is left? Can you find one-third of this remaining amount for sugar cookies?"

            "role": "Student",
            "content": "Let me see...\n\nShe had 10 kilograms to start, and used 5 kilograms + 2 kilograms = 7 kilograms.  \n\nThat leaves her with 3 kilograms (10 - 7 = 3).\n\nOne-third of 3 kilograms is 1 kilogram. Is this correct?"

So far, you've correctly calculated that after using 5 kilograms for chocolate chip cookies and 2 kilograms for peanut butter cookies, Liza has 3 kilograms of butter left. Now, if she uses one-third of the remaining 3 kilograms for sugar cookies, how much butter will be used? Can you find out what one-third of 3 kilograms is?"

            "content": "That's correct! One-third of 3 kilograms is indeed 1 kilogram. So, Liza uses 1 kilogram of butter for sugar cookies. Now, to find out how much butter is left after making all three kinds of cookies, you need to subtract the amount used for sugar cookies from the remaining 3 kilograms. Can you calculate that?"

            "role": "Student",
            "content": "If she had 3 kilograms and used 1 kilogram, then she has 2 kilograms left.\n\nSolution: 2"
