    "question": "Mark has a garden with flowers. He planted plants of three different colors in it. Ten of them are yellow, and there are 80% more of those in purple. There are only 25% as many green flowers as there are yellow and purple flowers. How many flowers does Mark have in his garden?",
    "answer": "35",

            "role": "Student",
            "content": "How do I figure out how many purple flowers there are? \n"
        },
        {
            "role": "Tutor",
            "content": "Let's think about it. If there are 10 yellow flowers, and the number of purple flowers is 80% more than the number of yellow flowers, can you calculate how many purple flowers that would be? Remember to add this number to the 10 yellow flowers to see if it matches any simple multiplication or division pattern with 25%."
        },
        {
            "role": "Student",
            "content": "Okay, so 80% of 10 is (80/100) * 10 = 8.\n\nThat means there are 10 + 8 = 18 purple flowers. \n\nIs there a way to figure out the number of green flowers using these numbers?\n\n\n\n"

        {
            "role": "Tutor",
            "content": "Great job figuring out there are 18 purple flowers! Now, let's think about the green flowers. You have 10 yellow and 18 purple flowers in total. Can you calculate what 25% of this total is? Remember, that will give you the number of green flowers."
        },
        {
            "role": "Student",
            "content": "Okay, so there are 10 + 18 = 28 yellow and purple flowers.\n\n25% of 28 is (25/100) * 28 = 7 green flowers.\n\n\nDoes that mean Mark has a total of 28 + 7 = 35 flowers in his garden?"
        },
        {
            "role": "Tutor",
            "content": "You've done well so far! Let's add up the number of each color of flower you have now:\n\n- Yellow: 10\n- Purple: 18\n- Green: 7\n\nAdding these together gives us \\(10 + 18 + 7 = 35\\) flowers. So, Mark has a total of 35 flowers in his garden.\n\nTo verify:\n- Yellow flowers are 10.\n- Purple flowers are 18.\n- Green flowers are 7.\n\nLet's add these up: \\(10 + 18 + 7 = 35\\).\n\nIs this correct? If so, you've solved the problem! Well done!"
