    "question": "Mary does her grocery shopping on Saturday. She does her shopping only at a specific store where she is allowed a credit of $100, which must be paid in full before her next shopping trip. That week she spent the full credit limit and paid $15 of it on Tuesday and $23 of it on Thursday. How much credit will Mary need to pay before her next shopping trip?",

            "content": "You've done great! Let's verify it together:\n\nMary initially had a credit limit of $100. She spent the full amount, which is $100. Then she paid back $15 on Tuesday and $23 on Thursday. So far, she has paid $15 + $23 = $38.\n\nTo find out how much more she needs to pay before her next shopping trip, you subtract what she has already paid from the total credit limit:\n\n$100 - $38 = $62\n\nSo, Mary will need to pay $62 before her next shopping trip. Well done!\n\nEND"
