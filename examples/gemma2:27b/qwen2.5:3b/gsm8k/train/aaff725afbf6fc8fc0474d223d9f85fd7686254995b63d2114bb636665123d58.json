    "question": "Jack is stranded on a desert island. He wants some salt to season his fish. He collects 2 liters of seawater in an old bucket. If the water is 20% salt, how many ml of salt will Jack get when all the water evaporates?",

Think about what happens when you remove the water from the mixture. Does the percentage of salt change?\nRemember, a liter is equal to 1000 ml. Can you use this information to help solve your problem?"

How can you find out how much salt is in 2000 ml of seawater if it's 20% salt? Think about what \"20%\" means and how to calculate it for 2000 ml.\nTo make it simpler, let's start by finding out how much salt would be in just a little bit of water\u2014like 1 liter. Then you can scale that up to the full 2 liters. How do you think you could do this?"

            "content": "That's correct! If you have 1000 ml and it\u2019s 20% salt, you can find out how much salt that is by multiplying 1000 ml by 0.20.\n\nLet's do this calculation: \\(1000 \\times 0.20 = ?\\) \n\nWhat do you get when you multiply these numbers? Once you have the amount of salt in 1 liter, can you then find out how much is in 2 liters? Remember, if it\u2019s still in the same percentage, you just need to scale up!\nDo you want to try this calculation now or should I show you how to do it?"

            "content": "I'll try the calculation myself.\n\n1000 ml * 0.20 = 200 ml\n\n\nSo there are 200 ml of salt in 1 liter of seawater.\n\nSince Jack has 2 liters of seawater, he would have double the amount of salt, right?\n\n\n\nThat means he'd get 200 ml * 2 = 400 ml of salt!"

Since Jack has 2 liters (which is the same as 2000 ml) of seawater, you correctly calculated that he would get:\n\n\\[200 \\text{ ml} \\times 2 = 400 \\text{ ml}\\]\n\nSo, Jack will get 400 ml of salt when all the water evaporates. This is correct!\n\nCongratulations on figuring it out! If you have any more questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask. You've done a great job with this problem."
