            "content": "That's correct! Joy reads at a rate of 0.4 pages per minute. To find out how many minutes it takes her to read 120 pages, you divided the total number of pages by her reading rate.\n\nNow, if she reads for 300 minutes, and there are 60 minutes in an hour, how many hours does that equate to? Can you convert those minutes into hours?"
