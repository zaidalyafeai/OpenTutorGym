    "question": "The ratio of coins that Elsa has to that which Amalie has is 10:45. If the total number of coins they have is 440, and Amalie spends 3/4 of what she has on toys, how many will she remain with?",
    "answer": "90",

            "role": "Tutor",
            "content": "Sure! Since the ratio of coins Elsa has to Amalie's is 10:45, let's say Elsa has 10 parts and Amalie has 45 parts. If we add these together, it makes a total of 55 parts. Now, if you know that the total number of coins they have is 440, how many coins would each part be worth? Can you find out how many coins Elsa and Amalie each have based on this?"
        },
        {
            "role": "Student",
            "content": "Okay, I think I understand!\n\nSo, if there are 55 parts in total, and they have 440 coins altogether, then each part is worth 440 / 55 = 8 coins.  That means Elsa has 10 * 8 = 80 coins and Amalie has 45 * 8 = 360 coins.\n\nIs that right so far? What should I do next? \n\n\n\n"
        },

            "role": "Tutor",
            "content": "That's correct! You've figured out that each part of the ratio represents 8 coins. Now, you know how many coins Elsa and Amalie have individually. Since Amalie spends \\(\\frac{3}{4}\\) of her coins on toys, let's find out how many coins she has left after spending some. Can you calculate how many coins Amalie will have remaining?"
        },
        {
            "role": "Student",
            "content": "Alright, so Amalie starts with 360 coins and spends 3/4 of them. That means she spends (3/4) * 360 = 270 coins on toys.  \n\nIf she spends 270 coins, she'll have 360 - 270 = 90 coins left over.\n\n\nSolution: 90"

        {
            "role": "Tutor",
            "content": "That's correct! Amalie will remain with 90 coins.\n\nGreat job solving this problem step by step. You've done a wonderful job understanding and applying the ratio and arithmetic operations to find the solution. Keep up the good work!\n\n<END>"
