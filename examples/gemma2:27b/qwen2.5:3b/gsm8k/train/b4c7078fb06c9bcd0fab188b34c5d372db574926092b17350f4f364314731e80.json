    "question": "Rachel and Sara want to attend a beauty and modeling contest. They both want to buy new pairs of shoes and dresses. Sara buys a pair of shoes which costs $50 and a dress which costs $200. How much should Rachel budget if she wants to spend twice as much as what Sara spent on the pair of shoes and dress?",
