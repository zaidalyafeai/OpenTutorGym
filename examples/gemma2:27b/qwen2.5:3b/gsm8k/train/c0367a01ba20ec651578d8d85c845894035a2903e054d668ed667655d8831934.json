    "question": "Alexis is applying for a new job and bought a new set of business clothes to wear to the interview. She went to a department store with a budget of $200 and spent $30 on a button-up shirt, $46 on suit pants, $38 on a suit coat, $11 on socks, and $18 on a belt. She also purchased a pair of shoes, but lost the receipt for them. She has $16 left from her budget. How much did Alexis pay for the shoes?",
    "answer": "41",
    "conversation": [

        },
        {
            "role": "Tutor",
            "content": "Sure! Think about adding up all the amounts Alexis spent on the shirt, pants, coat, socks, and belt. Then see if you can find out how much more she needed to reach her budget of $200 after those purchases. Does that make sense?"
        },
        {
            "role": "Student",
            "content": "Okay, I think I understand.\n\nSo if I add up $30 + $46 + $38 + $11 + $18, that will tell me how much she spent on everything except the shoes? \n\n\n\n"
        },
        {
            "role": "Tutor",
            "content": "That's right! If you add up those amounts, you'll find out how much Alexis spent on the shirt, pants, coat, socks, and belt. Then you can subtract that total from her budget to see how much she had left for the shoes. Let's do it together: $30 + $46 + $38 + $11 + $18 = ___________. What do you get?"
        },
        {
            "role": "Student",
            "content": "$30 + $46 + $38 + $11 + $18 = $143 \n\n\n"

            "content": "Great job so far! You've calculated that Alexis spent $143 on the shirt, pants, coat, socks, and belt. Now, if her budget was $200 and she has $16 left, how much did she spend on the shoes? Remember to subtract $143 from $200. What's the result?"

            "role": "Tutor",
            "content": "Well done! You've correctly calculated that Alexis spent $57 on the shoes.\n\nTo verify:\nHer budget was $200.\nShe spent $143 ($30 + $46 + $38 + $11 + $18).\nSo, she had $200 - $143 = $57 left for the shoes.\nTherefore, her total expenditure on the shoes is indeed $57.\n\nCongratulations! You've solved the problem correctly. If you have any more questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask. Good job!"
