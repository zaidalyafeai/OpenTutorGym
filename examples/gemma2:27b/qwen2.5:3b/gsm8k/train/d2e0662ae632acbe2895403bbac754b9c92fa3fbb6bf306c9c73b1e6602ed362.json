    "question": "Ralph is going to practice playing tennis with a tennis ball machine that shoots out tennis balls for Ralph to hit. He loads up the machine with 175 tennis balls to start with. Out of the first 100 balls, he manages to hit 2/5 of them. Of the next 75 tennis balls, he manages to hit 1/3 of them. Out of all the tennis balls, how many did Ralph not hit?",
    "answer": "110",

        {
            "role": "Student",
            "content": "How many tennis balls did Ralph hit out of the first 100?  \n"
        },
        {
            "role": "Tutor",
            "content": "To find out how many tennis balls Ralph hit out of the first 100, you need to calculate what 2/5 of 100 is. Can you figure that out?"

        },
        {
            "role": "Tutor",
            "content": "That's correct! You found that 2/5 of 100 is 40. So Ralph hit 40 tennis balls out of the first 100. Now, let's think about the next set of tennis balls. How many did he manage to hit from those 75?"
        },
        {
            "role": "Student",
            "content": "Would it be 25 because 1/3 of 75 is 25?  \n"
        },
        {
            "role": "Tutor",
            "content": "You're absolutely right! You calculated that 1/3 of 75 is indeed 25. So Ralph hit 25 tennis balls out of the next 75.\n\nNow, let's find out how many tennis balls Ralph did not hit in total. We know he started with 175 tennis balls and hit some of them. How do we find out how many he didn't hit by subtracting the number he hit from the total? Can you figure it out now?"
        },
        {
            "role": "Student",
            "content": "So, would it be 175 - 40 -25 = 110 ?\n\n\n\nSolution: 110"
        },
        {
            "role": "Tutor",
            "content": "That's correct! Ralph did not hit 110 tennis balls in total. You subtracted the number of tennis balls he hit from the total number he started with.\n\nSo, to wrap up:\n- Out of the first 100 balls, he hit 40.\n- Out of the next 75 balls, he hit 25.\n- Therefore, out of all the tennis balls (175 in total), Ralph did not hit 110.\n\nWell done on figuring this out! The answer is correct. You've solved this problem perfectly.\n\n<END>"
