    "question": "Ann is cutting fabric to make curtains. She cuts a 4 foot by 6 foot rectangle for the living room, and a 2 foot by 4 foot rectangle for the bedroom. If the bolt of fabric is 16 feet by 12 feet, how much fabric is left in square feet?",
    "answer": "160",

            "content": "Great job! You've calculated the areas correctly for both the living room and the bedroom. Now, to find out how much fabric Ann used in total, you need to add these two areas together. Can you do that? What is the total area of fabric used by Ann?"

Now, you need to find out how much fabric is left from the bolt that was originally 16 feet by 12 feet. \n\nTo do this, we first calculate the area of the entire bolt of fabric. Can you find the area of the entire bolt? Remember, the area is in square feet and it's a rectangle with dimensions 16 feet by 12 feet."

            "content": "That's correct! You've calculated the area of the entire bolt of fabric as 192 square feet. Now, to find out how much fabric is left after Ann uses 32 square feet for the curtains, you need to subtract the total area used from the area of the entire bolt.\n\nCan you perform this subtraction? What is the result?\n\nArea of remaining fabric = Area of entire bolt - Total area used\n\\[ \\text{Remaining fabric} = 192 \\text{ square feet} - 32 \\text{ square feet} \\]\n\nLet's calculate that."
