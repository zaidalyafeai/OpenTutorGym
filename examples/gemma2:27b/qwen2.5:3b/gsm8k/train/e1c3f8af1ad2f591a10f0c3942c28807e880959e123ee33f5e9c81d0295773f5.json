Then, to find out how many students got a grade of B or above, you need to subtract this from 100%.\n\nSo, \\( 100 - 2.5 = 97.5 \\).\n\nThis calculation is correct.\n\nTherefore, the number of students who got a final grade of B and above is **97.5**. However, since we can't have half a student, let's confirm if this aligns with practical considerations in counting whole students.\n\nCongratulations on arriving at the solution! \n\n<END>"
