    "question": "To make pizza, together with other ingredients, Kimber needs 10 cups of water, 16 cups of flour, and 1/2 times as many teaspoons of salt as the number of cups of flour. Calculate the combined total number of cups of water, flour, and teaspoons of salt that she needs to make the pizza.",

Since she needs 16 cups of flour, can you calculate how many teaspoons of salt that would be? Remember, one teaspoon is often considered to be about a third of a tablespoon, but for this calculation, just focus on finding out half of 16 cups."

            "content": "You've correctly calculated that Kimber needs 8 teaspoons of salt. Now, you need to add the cups of water and flour to the teaspoons of salt together to find the total combined amount. Can you calculate what that would be? Remember, you have already determined that she needs 10 cups of water and 16 cups of flour."
