    "question": "A Statistics student wants to find out the average daily allowance of the middle school students. According to his survey, 2/3 of the students receive an average of $6 allowance per day while the rest gets an average of $4 a day. If he surveyed 60 students, what is the total amount of money those 60 students get in a day?",

            "role": "Tutor",
            "content": "That's correct! You've calculated that 40 students receive $6 per day. Now, let's find out how many students get $4 per day. Can you figure that out using the total number of students and the number who get $6 per day?"

            "content": "Yes, you've done it! So now you know that 20 students receive $4 per day. To find the total amount of money those 60 students get in a day, what do you think we need to do next? Can you calculate the total by considering both groups of students and their average allowances?"
        },

            "role": "Student",
            "content": "Okay, so for the $6 group: 40 students * $6/student = $240.\n\nAnd for the $4 group: 20 students * $4/student = $80. \n\nDo we add those amounts together to get the total?"

            "role": "Tutor",
            "content": "Exactly! You've calculated that the 40 students who receive $6 per day contribute a total of $240, and the 20 students who receive $4 per day contribute a total of $80. To find the total amount of money those 60 students get in a day, you need to add these two amounts together. Can you do that calculation now?"

            "role": "Student",
