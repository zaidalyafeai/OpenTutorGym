Let's break it down step by step using combinations.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding Combinations\n\nCombinations are used when you want to find out how many ways you can choose items from a set where the order does not matter. In this case, we need to choose 5 snacks out of 12.\n\nThe formula for combinations is:\n\\[ \\binom{n}{r} = \\frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!} \\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\( n \\) is the total number of items (snacks).\n- \\( r \\) is the number of items to choose.\n- \\( ! \\) denotes factorial, which means multiplying a series of descending numbers.\n\n### Step 2: Applying the Formula\n\nFor your problem:\n- \\( n = 12 \\) (total snacks)\n- \\( r = 5 \\) (snacks to choose)\n\nLet's plug these values into the formula:\n\\[ \\binom{12}{5} = \\frac{12!}{5!(12-5)!} \\]\n\n### Step 3: Simplifying the Factorials\n\nFirst, calculate the factorials:\n- \\( 12! \\) (12 factorial) is the product of all positive integers up to 12.\n- \\( 5! \\) (5 factorial) is the product of all positive integers up to 5.\n- \\( 7! \\) (7 factorial) is the product of all positive integers up to 7.\n\nNotice that:\n\\[ 12! = 12 \\times 11 \\times 10 \\times 9 \\times 8 \\times 7! \\]\n\nSo,\n\\[ \\frac{12!}{5!(12-5)!} = \\frac{12 \\times 11 \\times 10 \\times 9 \\times 8 \\times 7!}{5! \\times 7!} \\]\n\nThe \\( 7! \\) in the numerator and denominator cancel out, leaving:\n\\[ \\binom{12}{5} = \\frac{12 \\times 11 \\times 10 \\times 9 \\times 8}{5!} \\]\n\n### Step 4: Calculate \\( 5! \\)\n\nNow calculate \\( 5! \\):\n\\[ 5! = 5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 120 \\]\n\nSo,\n\\[ \\binom{12}{5} = \\frac{12 \\times 11 \\times 10 \\times 9 \\times 8}{120} \\]\n\n### Step 5: Perform the Multiplication and Division\n\nLet's do the multiplication in the numerator:\n\\[ 12 \\times 11 = 132 \\]\n\\[ 132 \\times 10 = 1320 \\]\n\\[ 1320 \\times 9 = 11880 \\]\n\\[ 11880 \\times 8 = 95040 \\]\n\nNow, divide by the denominator:\n\\[ \\frac{95040}{120} = 792 \\]\n\n### Final Answer\n\nSo, the number of different ways you can choose 5 snacks out of 12 is:\n\\[ \\boxed{792} \\]\n\nGreat job solving this problem step by step!
